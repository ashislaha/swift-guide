# Formatting

## Conventions

Parameterized attributes are written on their own lines.


## Rationale

Parameterized attributes (such as @availability(...) or @objc(...)) are each written on their own line immediately before the declaration to which they apply.
They are lexicographically ordered and are indented at the same level as the declaration.

Attributes without parameters (for example, @objc without arguments, @IBOutlet, or @NSManaged) are lexicographically ordered and may be placed on the same line as the declaration.

#### Example

### Define a objc Protocol, enum, class, function:

``` swift
// good: @objc(XXX) defined in its own line 
@objc(MSFActivityIndicatorViewSize)
public enum ActivityIndicatorViewSize: Int, CaseIterable {
	case xSmall
	case small
	case medium
	case large
	case xLarge
}

// good: as @objc does not contain any parameter, no need to separate it out to a different line.
@objc func calculateSum(firstOperand: Int, secondOperand: Int) -> Int {
	return firstOperand + secondOperand
}

// good: parameterized @objc(XXX)
@objc(OFMActionsHandling)
public protocol ActionsHandling: NSObjectProtocol {
	@objc(handleActionFromViewController:inWindow:)
	func handleAction(viewController: UIViewController, window: UIWindow)
}


@objc(MSFBlurringView) open class BlurringView: UIView {
	// bad: @objc(XXX) class definition should be in a seperate line.
}
```
